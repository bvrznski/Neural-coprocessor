// MGPU Bridge - DEPTH TAP. See history/P0_DENOISE_RECORD.md R53 and R59.
//
// P0.0 sampled depth and discarded every pixel, purely to keep ReShade's DEPTH
// semantic bound. P0.1 keeps that job and adds a second one that may remove an
// entire subsystem from the transport.
//
// WHY THERE IS NOW A RENDER TARGET
//
// The game renders depth at 65-67 percent of output (R54), and DLSS-NR runs at
// OUTPUT resolution. Something has to resample. Doing it on GPU 1 means
// building a root signature, a shader, a PSO and a descriptor heap in a
// project that today has NONE of those - grep the whole of gpu1_context.cpp
// and there is not one CreateRootSignature, CreateComputePipelineState or
// D3DCompile in it.
//
// This pass is already a shader, already runs on GPU 0, and ReShade already
// renders it at BUFFER_WIDTH x BUFFER_HEIGHT - which IS output resolution. So
// sampling the render-resolution depth here and writing it to a full-size
// target does the resample for free, in code that already exists, with ReShade
// owning every piece of state.
//
// It also removes two other named risks: the target is single-plane R32F, so
// none of the R32G8_TYPELESS plane-0 footprint care applies to what crosses
// the bus; and reversed-Z becomes a one-line decision in a file we own rather
// than a guess about what DLSSNR.DepthInverted means.
//
// IT COSTS BUS BYTES. Output-resolution R32F is the same size as the colour
// payload, where render-resolution depth would have been about 42 percent of
// it. That trade is the open question, not this file.
//
// AND IT MAY NOT BE READABLE AT ALL - WHICH IS WHAT THIS BUILD TESTS
//
// Every run so far shows get_texture_binding returning res=0x0 for ordinary
// effect textures - texLUT, BackupTex, MaskTex - and a real resource ONLY for
// DepthBufferTex, which is bound by SEMANTIC. Every one of those was in a
// DISABLED effect, so it proves nothing either way. This technique is enabled,
// so MGPU_DepthOutTex answers it: the semantic lane already walks every texture
// variable and will print this one with no C++ change at all.
//
//   a real resource on the MGPU_DepthOutTex row  -> the whole GPU 1 shader
//                                                   subsystem is unnecessary
//   res=0x0                                       -> it is necessary, and we
//                                                   learned that for free

// ---- R69: THE MOTION PROBE, AND IT COSTS NOTHING ----
//
// ReShade's semantic system is a PUSH: whoever detects a buffer writes it into
// every variable declared with that semantic (R48). DEPTH is the one this rig
// has. Whether anything on this machine publishes MOTION - an optical-flow
// add-on, a future ReShade, the game's own vectors through some path - has
// never been asked, and asking costs one texture declaration.
//
// The semantic lane already walks EVERY texture variable and prints what each
// is bound to. So this needs no C++ at all: a real resource on the
// MGPU_MotionProbeTex row means motion vectors are available the same way
// depth turned out to be, and res=0x0 means they are not.
//
// R66 bound depth and the picture did not change. The leading explanation is
// that depth's job is reprojection and MVec is null, so depth has nothing to
// work with. If that is right, THIS ROW is the next thing that matters.

    // the reversed-Z decision stays where it belongs - next to the model.

    // ReShade::DepthBuffer filters LINEAR, so sampling a render-resolution
    // depth at output-resolution coordinates IS the upsample. Bilinear across
